As a result, we get the following set of functions:\n",

In this case, the $\\beta$ coefficient is a weight for exponential smoothing. The final prediction is the sum of the model values of the intercept and trend."

    "As you could have guessed, the idea is to add a third component - seasonality. This means that we should not use this method if our time series is not expected to have seasonality. Seasonal components in the model will explain repeated variations around intercept and trend, and it will be specified by the length of the season, in other words by the period after which the variations repeat. For each observation in the season, there is a separate component; for example, if the length of the season is 7 days (a weekly seasonality), we will have 7 seasonal components, one for each day of the week.\n",

    "The intercept now depends on the current value of the series minus any corresponding seasonal component. Trend remains unchanged, and the seasonal component depends on the current value of the series minus the intercept and on the previous value of the component. Take into account that the component is smoothed through all the available seasons; for example, if we have a Monday component, then it will only be averaged with other Mondays. You can read more on how averaging works and how the initial approximation of the trend and seasonal components is done [here](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc435.htm). Now that we have the seasonal component, we can predict not just one or two steps ahead but an arbitrary $m$ future steps ahead, which is very encouraging.\n",

    "### Stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start modeling, we should mention such an important property of time series: [**stationarity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a process is stationary, that means it does not change its statistical properties over time, namely its mean and variance. (The constancy of variance is called [homoscedasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoscedasticity))The covariance function does not depend on time; it should only depend on the distance between observations. You can see this visually on the images in the post by [Sean Abu](http://www.seanabu.com/2016/03/22/time-series-seasonal-ARIMA-model-in-python/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The red graph below is not stationary because the mean increases over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/files/20c/9d8/a63/20c9d8a633ec436f91dccd4aedcc6940.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- We were unlucky with the variance and see the varying spread of values over time\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/files/b88/eec/a67/b88eeca676d642449cab135273fd5a95.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, the covariance of the i th term and the (i + m) th term should not be a function of time. In the following graph, you will notice that the spread becomes closer as time increases. Hence, the covariance is not constant with time in the right chart.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/files/2f6/1ee/cb2/2f61eecb20714352840748b826e38680.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So why is stationarity so important? Because it is easy to make predictions on a stationary series since we can assume that the future statistical properties will not be different from those currently observed. Most of the time-series models, in one way or the other, try to predict those properties (mean or variance, for example). Furture predictions would be wrong if the original series were not stationary. Unfortunately, most of the time series that we see outside of textbooks are non-stationary, but we can (and should) change this.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order to combat non-stationarity, we have to know our enemy, so to speak. Let's see how we can detect it. We will look at white noise and random walks to learn how to get from one to another for free."

The third plot deviates even more from the 0 mean but still oscillates about the mean. Finally, with $\\rho=1$, we have a random walk process i.e. a non-stationary time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because, after reaching the critical value, the series $x_t = \\rho x_{t-1} + e_t$ does not return to its mean value. If we subtract $x_{t-1}$ from both sides, we will get $x_t - x_{t-1} = (\\rho - 1) x_{t-1} + e_t$, where the expression on the left is referred to as the first difference. If $\\rho=1$, then the first difference gives us stationary white noise $e_t$. This is the main idea behind the [Dickey-Fuller test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test) for stationarity of time series (testing the presence of a unit root). If we can get a stationary series from a non-stationary series using the first difference, we call those series integrated of order 1. The null hypothesis of the test is that the time series is non-stationary, which was rejected on the first three plots and finally accepted on the last one. We have to say that the first difference is not always enough to get a stationary series as the process might be integrated of order d, d > 1 (and have multiple unit roots). In such cases, the augmented Dickey-Fuller test is used, which checks multiple lags at once.\n",
    "\n",

Increasing the lag, say, up to 6, will allow the model to make predictions 6 steps ahead; however it will use data observed 6 steps back. If something fundamentally changes the series during that unobserved period, the model will not catch these changes and will return forecasts with a large error.

If it is undesirable to explode a dataset by using many dummy variables that can lead to the loss of information and if they cannot be used as real values because of the conflicts like \"0 hours < 23 hours\", then it's possible to encode a variable with slightly more interpretable values. The natural idea is to encode with the mean value of the target variable. In our example, every day of the week and every hour of the day can be encoded by the corresponding average number of ads watched during that day or hour. It's very important to make sure that the mean value is calculated over the training set only (or over the current cross-validation fold only) so that the model is not aware of the future."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed different time series analysis and prediction methods. Unfortunately, or maybe luckily, there is no one way to solve these kind of problems. Methods developed in the 1960s (and some even in the beginning of the 21st century) are still popular, along with LSTMs and RNNs (not covered in this article). This is partially related to the fact that the prediction task, like any other data-related task, requires creativity in so many aspects and definitely requires research. In spite of the large number of formal quality metrics and approaches to parameters estimation, it is often necessary to try something different for each time series. Last but not least, the balance between quality and cost is important. As a good example, the SARIMA model can produce spectacular results after tuning but can require many hours of ~~tambourine dancing~~ time series manipulation while a simple linear regression model can be built in 10 minutes and can achieve more or less comparable results."
